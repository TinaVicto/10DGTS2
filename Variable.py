# different types of variables
# Store a number
num_1 = 60 # assigning 60 to num_1
print (num_1) # This displays what num_1 contains 

# Store a string
name = "Veroncia"
print (name)
name = "heheheh" # reassinging value to an existint one
print(name)

# Do calculations in a variable and store the result
sum = 5 + 5 # good practice need space 
print (sum)
sum = "5 + 5 = 10" # this is a string 
print(sum) 

# Adding strings together is called concatenation 
concatenation = num_1 + sum_string
print(concatenation)
